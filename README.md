# HiVolts
Recreates 1970s HiVolts game in Java.

Introduction:
This project recreates the HiVolts game in Java, a game with a player, mhos(enemies), and fences. The object of the game is to 
eliminate all of the mhos without running into any of them. The mhos will chase you across the board and it is up to you to run 
the mhos into fences to kill them. However, running into a fence yourself or a mho will cause you to lose the game.
